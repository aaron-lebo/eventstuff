Prisoners are being tortured and none were released\". He said that security forces did not withdraw their tanks from the streets, but just hid them and then redeployed them after the observers left. Malek also said \"The regime didn't meet any of our requests, in fact they were trying to deceive us and steer us away from what was really happening, towards insignificant things\". He said that those who were supposedly freed and were shown on TV, were actually people who had been randomly grabbed off the street. \"They were detained for four or five days in tough conditions and later released as if they had been real prisoners\". Malek also said that he had seen snipers on top of buildings: \"On one, there were even army officers in front of the building, while snipers were on the roof. Some on our team preferred to maintain good relations with the regime and denied that there were snipers\". He said that Assad's government \"has gained a lot of time that has helped it implement its plan. Therefore I've decided to withdraw from this mission\".
