Five people, including a 14-year-old boy, were also shot dead in the southern town of Deraa, cradle of the uprising against Assad\u2019s autocratic regime, said the Britain-based Observatory. Around 30 people were shot and wounded in Homs, in the Damascus suburb of Harasta and in Maaret Numan in the northwestern province of Idlib, the Observatory and the opposition Local Coordination Committees (LCC) reported, according to AFP.
